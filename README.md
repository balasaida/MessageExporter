# MyMessageExporter

MyMessageExporter gives you an idea about how to create a framework to export the message object (comments, annotations, etc) to different servers.

Note: This framework does not show you the firebase/graphQL/URLSession integration. It helps you to understand the designing the system.

## Requirements

- iOS 12.0+ | macOS 10.15.5+
- Xcode 12.0.1

### Installing

#### Carthage (iOS 12+, OS X 10.15.5+)

You can use [Carthage](https://github.com/balasaida/MyMessageExporter) to install `MyMessageExporter` by adding it to your `Cartfile`:

```
git "https://github.com/balasaida/MyMessageExporter" "develop"
```

If you use Carthage to build your dependencies, make sure you have added `MyMessageExporter.framework` to the "Linked Frameworks and Libraries" section of your target, and have included them in your Carthage framework copying build phase.
